About
====================
This XML document represents the rule definition of standard English grammar for
Wintermute. This document represents the means of converting linguistics into
ontological information in the English language. God be with us. There's a
document that will be posted to
  <http://www.thesii.org/wiki/SII:Projects:Wintermute:LexicalBindings> soon. I
(Jacky Alcine) have to convert the document from ODT to MediaWiki (or if
someone's willing to; e-mail me at jacky.alcine@thesii.org and I'll send it to
you.)

Documentation
===================
1. Rule Elements

Rule elements are expected to only have the attribute 'type'. It should contain
ONE (1) type or part of a specific type of node that should match it. In the
future, rules will be allowed (and recommended) to be subset within each other
in order of similiarity (ie: The rule 'A' would contain 'Ad', and 'Ae'. 'Ae'
would contain 'Aen' and 'Aep'). This way, it'd make it possible to enable and
disable certain rules by type.

2. Bind Elements

Bind elements are perhaps the most cruical and dynamic elements of the RuleSet
document. They're required to have the 'with' attriubte, which specifys what
happens to the nodes before, during, or after linking.

2a. Pre-link Attributes
These attributes effect the linking process before it happens. Currently, there
aren't any attributes that fall in this category.

2b. Concurrent Link Attributes
These attribute effect the linking process while it happens.

 > linkAction: A list of actions to take place during the linking process. This
    attribute can contain a list of values or just one for ease of use. Values
    include:

    * reverse: This swaps the source node with the destination node and flips
      the locale and flags of the link. Used for ontological link simplicity.

    * othertype: This sets the flags of the link to the flags of the source
      node.

    * thistype: This sets the flags of the link to the flags of the destination
      node.

2c. Post-link Attributes
These attributes effect the post results of linking.

 > hide: [default = 'no'] Prevents this node (source node) from appearing on
the next round of parsing.

 > hideNext: [default = 'no'] Prevents the next node (destination node) from
appearing on its next round of parsing (2 rounds from now).

 > skipWord: [default = 'yes'] Doesn't allow the destination node to have a
chance at being parsed.

 > hideFilter: [default = ''] Hides a set of words from appearing on the next
round of parsing; a wrapper for the 'hide' attribute.

Changelog
==================
[#1] (15 Aug 2011 2:26 AM): Biggest issue right now, if there's a rule defined
for 'B' and there's a rule defined for 'Bz' and the node in question *is* 'Bz',
the 'B' rule will have precedence ONLY if it comes before 'Bz' in the document.
At the moment, you must put sub-rules (or rules targeted at specific types of
words) before the general definition.

[#2] (15 Aug 2011 9:51 PM): Fixed issue in changelog entry #1 in script by
using a rating system, but now adjectives don't link to anything after it. This
might be a human or logical error. (APPEND) Yes, it's a logical error, because
when I toggle the 'hide' attribute to 'no' (by deleting it), it generates an
extra, useless link and the whole syntax is messed up. *sigh*

[#3] (15 Aug 2011 11:37 PM): So, the issue in changelog entry #2 was a rule
mistake. Apparently, the generic 'A' rule took over and messed this up. -___-

[#4] (16 Aug 2011 12:18 AM): Incredible progress, the hideFilter attribute now
works to full efficiency. And it really rox!
