  ontological information in the English language. God be with us.

  ===================
  Biggest issue right now, if there's a rule defined for 'B' and there's a rule defined
  for 'Bz' and the node in question *is* 'Bz', the 'B' rule will have precedence ONLY if it
  comes before 'Bz' in the document. At the moment, you must put sub-rules (or rules targeted at
  specific types of words) before the general definition.
